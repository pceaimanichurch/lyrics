Through many waters
Many mountains
Jesu made a way for me
He gave me victory

Through every valley
Every gate
Jesu made a way for me
He gave me victory

Through many waters
Many mountains
Jesu made a way for me
He gave me victory

Through every valley
Every gate
Jesu made a way for me
He gave me victory

Blessed be the lord
The God of David
He taught me how to war
Now I know to fight
With lifted hands

And on my knees oh

Crying out

Clapping hands

I lift a shout

I raise a sound

I pray a prayer

Cos Victory is sure

I came running

Jesu carry me

I came crying

Jesu wipe my tears

He touched my life and

He gave me life

He healed my body

And made me whole

I came running

Jesu carry me

I came crying

Jesu wipe my tears

He touched my life and

He gave me life

Healed my body

And made me whole

Through many waters

Many mountain

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory


Through every valley

Every gate

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory ×2

Who are you

O mountain

Who are you

Who are you

O mountain

Who are you

Before my lord

Who are you

O mountain

Who are you

Who are you

O mountain

Who are you

Before my Lord

CHORUS

Through many waters

Many mountains

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory

Through every valley

Every gate

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory ×2

Through every valley

Every gate

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory

Jesu made a way for me

He gave me victory ×5
