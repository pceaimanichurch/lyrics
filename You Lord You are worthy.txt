You Lord, You are worthy
And no one can worship You for me
For all the things You've done for me
And no one can worship You for me

Here's my worship
All of my worship
Receive my worship
All of my worship
Here's my worship
All of my worship
Receive my worship
All of my worship

You Lord, You are worthy
And no one can worship You for me
For all the things You've done for me
And no one can worship You for me

[Chorus]
Here's my worship
All of my worship
Receive my worship
All of my worship

And I will not be silent
I will always worship You
As long as I am breathing
I will always worship You
And I will not be silent
I will always worship You

As long as I am breathing
I will always worship You
And I will not be silent
I will always worship You
As long as I am breathing
I will always worship You

Here's my worship
All of my worship
Receive my worship
All of my worship
