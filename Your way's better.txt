[Verse 1: Forrest Frank]
When I’m overwhelmed within
From the weight of all my sin
I need a friend to call my own
I need a house to call my home
When I’m broken down inside
And there’s nowhere else to hide
I need a place where I feel known
Can someone help me?
Then I hear Your reply
Bringing teardrops to my eyes
Saying I’m not alone

[Chorus: Forrest Frank]
Oh Lord, I need You now more than ever
Would You put my heart back together?
I searched the world till my hеad hurt
Just to find out Your way’s better
Oh-oh, Your way's bettеr
Oh-oh, Your way's better
Oh, Lord, Your way's better
Jesus, Your way's better

[Verse 2: Forrest Frank]
Lord, I am so thankful for the ways that You blessed me
Everything You say making waves like a jetski
You love every part of me, even when I was messy
Now I see the heart in Your beauty
So, I can finally sing Jehovah-Jireh, Provider
Your way always gets me higher
Even on my darkest days, You’re a lighter
My Messiah

Lord, I need You now more than ever

[Outro: Forrest Frank & Choir, Forrest Frank & Choir]
Ohh-ohh, Your way's better

It’s better than the rest
