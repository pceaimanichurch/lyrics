​What A Fellowship, ​
What A Joy Divine,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms,​
What A Blessedness, ​
What A Peace is Mine,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.​

Leaning, Leaning,​
Safe And Secure From All Alarms;​
Leaning, Leaning,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.

Oh, How Sweet To Walk ​
In This Pilgrim Way,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms,​
Oh, How Bright The Path ​
Grows From Day To day,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.​

Leaning, Leaning,​
Safe And Secure From All Alarms;​
Leaning, Leaning,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.

What Have I To Dread, ​
What Have I To Fear,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms?​
 I have blessed peace ​
with my Lord so near​
Leaning on the everlasting arms.​

Leaning, Leaning,​
Safe And Secure From All Alarms;​
Leaning, Leaning,​
Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.
