Lord I’m ready for the power
Miracle working power
Let your power flow
As we worship at your feet

Lord I’m ready for the fire
Chain breaking fire
Let your fire fall
As we worship at your feet

… Lord I’m ready for the power
Mountain moving power
Let your power flow
As we worship at your feet

Lord I’m ready for the fire
Destiny changing fire
Let you fire fall, Lord
As we worship at your feet
