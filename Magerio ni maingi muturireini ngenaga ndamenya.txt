There are kings
There are kingdoms
There are mountains and there are thrones
But only Yeshua
Will reign forever
To His kingdom there'll be no end


Ah ah ah ah
To His Kingdom there'll be no end
Ah ah ah ah
To His Kingdom there'll be no end


There are names
There are titles
There are legends and tales of strength

But only Yeshua
Will reign forever
To His Kingdom there'll be no end


There are chains
There are curses
But no evil can stand Your Power

Only Yeshua
Will reign forever
To His Kingdom there'll be no end


There are times
There are seasons
Every glory will fade away
Only Yeshua
Will reign forever
To His Kingdom there'll be no end
