I WILL SING THE WONDROUS STORY
Of the Christ Who died for me;
How He left His home in glory
For the cross of Calvary.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me;
Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.

I was lost: but Jesus found me--
Found the sheep that went astray;
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me;
Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.

I was bruised: but Jesus healed me--
Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me, But He freed me from them all.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me;
Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.

Days of darkness still come o'er me;
Sorrow's path l often tread:
But the Saviour still is with me;
By His hand I'm safely led.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me;
Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.

He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet:
Then He'll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.

Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me;
Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.
