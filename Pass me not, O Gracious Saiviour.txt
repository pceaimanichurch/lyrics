Pass me not, O Gracious Saiviour
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Let me at a throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.


Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Trusting only in Thy merit, Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.


Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

Thou, the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in Heaven but Thee?


Saviour, Saviour, Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.
