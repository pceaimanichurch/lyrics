Goodbye world, I stay no longer with you
Goodbye pleasures of sin, I stay no longer with you
I've made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life
I've made up my mind to go God's way the rest of my life

Born, born, born again Thank God, I'm born again

Born of the water, spirit and the blood
Thank God, I'm born again
Born of the water, spirit and the blood
Thank God, I'm born again
