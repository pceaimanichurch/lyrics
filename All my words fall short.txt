[Verse 1]
All my words fall short
I got nothing new
How could I express
All my gratitude?

[Verse 2]
I could sing these songs
As I often do
But every song must end
And You never do

[Chorus]
So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah

[Verse 3]
I've got one response
I've got just one move
With my arm stretched wide
I will worship You

[Chorus]
So I throw up my hands
And praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah

[Bridge]
So come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord
Oh, come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord

Come on my soul, oh, don't you get shy on me
Lift up your song, 'cause you've got a lion inside of those lungs
Get up and praise the Lord, hey
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
Praise the Lord

[Chorus]
So I throw up my hands
Praise You again and again
'Cause all that I have is a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And I know it's not much
But I've nothing else fit for a King
Except for a heart singing
Hallelujah, hallelujah
