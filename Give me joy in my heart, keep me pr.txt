Give me love in my heart, I pray
Give me love in my heart, keep me serving
Keep me serving 'til the end of day

Sing hosanna, sing hosanna
Sing hosanna to the King of kings
Sing hosanna, sing hosanna
Sing hosanna to the King

Give me light in my heart, I pray
Give me light in my heart, keep me shining
Keep me shining 'til the end of day
