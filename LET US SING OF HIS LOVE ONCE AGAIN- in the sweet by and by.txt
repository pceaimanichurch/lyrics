LET US SING OF HIS LOVE ONCE AGAIN--
Of the love that can never decay,
Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain, Till we praise Him again in that day.

In the sweet... "by and by"
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet... "by and by"
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

There is cleansing and healing for all Who have washed in the life-giving flood;
There is life everlasting and joy
At the right hand of God, through the blood.

In the sweet... "by and by"
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet... "by and by"
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

Even now while we taste of His love, We are filled with delight at His name;
But what will it be when above
We shall join in the song of the Lamb?

In the sweet... "by and by"
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet... "by and by"
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.
