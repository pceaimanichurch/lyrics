Master, speak! thy servant heareth,​
longing for thy gracious word,​
longing for thy voice that cheereth;​
Master, let it now be heard.​
I am listening, Lord, for thee;​
What hast thou to say to me?

Often through my heart is pealing​
Many another voice than Thine,​
Many an unwilled echo stealing​
From the walls of this Thy shrine.
Let Thy  longed-for accents fall;​
Master, speak! And silence all.

Master, speak! Though least and lowest,​
Let me not unheard depart;​
Master, speak! For oh, thou knowest 
All the yearning of my heart​
Knowest all its truest need;​
Speak! And make me blest indeed.

Master, speak, and make me ready​
when thy voice is truly heard​
with obedience glad and steady​
still to follow every word.​
I am listening, Lord, for thee:​
Master, speak! O, speak to me!​
​​​​
Speak to me by name, O Master,​
let me know it is to me;​
speak that I may follow faster​
with a step more firm and free,​
where the Shepherd leads the flock​
in the shadow of the rock!​
