One, two, three

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see (Mmm)

I used to be down so bad (So bad)
'Bout ready to throw my life away
Didn't know what I had (What I had)
Feeling locked up all night and day

'Till You came around (Around)
Picked me off the ground (The ground)
Was lost but now I'm found (One, two, three)

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see (Mmm)

Oh I do not deserve it, I'm too far from worth it
You're the only one who ever could be perfect
Every day I fall short but you still say I'm Yours
What a beautiful noise (Oh)
You say You won't go, despite all my failurеs
Tears fill my eyes (Oh)

'Causе you came around
Picked me off the ground
Was lost but now I'm found (One, two, three, mmm)

Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Was blind, but now I see (Mmm, it's an amazing grace)
Amazing grace how sweet the sound (It's an amazing grace)
That saved a wretch like me (It's an amazing grace)
I once was lost, but now I'm found (It's an amazing grace)
Was blind, but now I see (Mmm)

It's an amazing grace
It's an amazing grace
It's an amazing grace
It's an amazing grace
