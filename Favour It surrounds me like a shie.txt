Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
And it will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King (Repeat)

Power! It’s erupting from within
It is moving me from now
Until the day I see my King (Repeat)

Fire! It is burning in my soul
It is driving me from now
Until the day I see my King (Repeat)

Angels! The are all around me now
And they’re following me from now
Until the day I see my King (Repeat)

Mercy! It has washed me from sin
And it is opening doors for me
Until the day I see my King (Repeat)

Favour! It surrounds me like a shield
And it will cover me from now
Until the day I see my King (Repeat)
