This is my story
You are my song
All day, all night
I will sing of Your faithfulness

From my spirit to my soul
Until my voice re-echoes
You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my praise

Halle, halle, hallelujah
Halle, halle, hallelujah
You are worthy of my worship 
Worthy of my praise

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are worthy of my worship 
Worthy of my praise 

La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
You are worthy of my worship
Worthy of my chant
