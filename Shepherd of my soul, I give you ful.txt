Shepherd of my soul, I give you full control​
Wherever You may lead, I will follow.​
I have made the choice, to listen for Your voice​
Wherever You may lead I will go​

Be it in a quiet pasture or by a gentle stream,​
The Shepherd of my soul is by my side.​
Should I face a mighty mountain or a valley dark and deep,​
The Shepherd of my soul will be my guide​

Shepherd of my soul, I give you full control​
Wherever You may lead, I will follow.​
I have made the choice, to listen for Your voice​
Wherever You may lead I will go​
