Burdens are sometimes so many ​
And sometimes I feel so weary​
And sometime I almost stumble and I fall​
But the tender hands of Jesus​
Are the hands that keep me stable?​
Give me faith that that I shall make it ​
After all..

After all this life is over ​
And my burdens shall be lifted​
As I stand upon the mountain of the joy​
Looking over in the city ​
Where my Savior is preparing​
Give me faith that I shall make it​
After all…x2​

​By myself I cannot make it​
But I know He is there to help me​
He will hear and answer my cry when I call​
Keep on trusting keep on believing ​
Are the words I hear Him whisper​
Just a few more day to labor ​
After all..​

After all this life is over ​
And my burdens shall be lifted​
As I stand upon the mountain of the joy​
Looking over in the city ​
Where my Savior is preparing​
Give me faith that I shall make it​
After all…x2​
