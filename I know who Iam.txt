[Verse]
We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
And I know who I am
We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
For I know who I am

[Chorus]
I know who God says I am, what He says I am
Where He says I'm at, I know who I am
I know who God says I am, what He says I am
Where He says I'm at, I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am

[Verse]
We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
And I know who I am
We are a chosen generation
We've been called forth to show His excellence
All I require for life, God has given me
And I know who I am

[Chorus]
I know who God says I am, what He says I am
Where He says I'm at, I know who I am
I know who God says I am, what He says I am
Where He says I'm at, I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-ooh-oooh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh-oooh

[Bridge]
I am holy, and I am righteous oh-ooh…
I am so rich, and I am beautiful!...

[Chorus]
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
I'm working in power, I'm working miracles
I live a life of favour, for I know who I am
Take a look at me, I’m a wonder
It doesn't matter what you see now
Can you see His glory?
For I know who I am
Take a look at me, I’m a wonder
It doesn't matter what you see now
Can you see His glory?
For I know who I am
