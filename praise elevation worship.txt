[Intro: Chandler Moore]
Let's clap, one, two, hey
Oh, yea
Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord (You got it), praise the Lord
Let everything, let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
(Let everything) Let everything (Hey) that has breath (Hey)

[Verse 1: Brandon Lake]
I'll praise in the valley, praise on the mountain (Yeah)
I'll praise when I'm sure, praise when I'm doubting
I'll praise when outnumbered, praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the waters my enemies drown in

[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Chandler Moore, Both]
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord, oh my soul (C'mon)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Chandler Moore]
I'll praise when I feel it, and I'll praise when I don’t (Yeah)
I'll praise 'cause I know You’re still in control
'Cause my praise is a weapon, it's more than a sound (More than a sound)
Oh, my praise is the shout that brings Jericho down (Yeah)

[Chorus: Brandon Lake & Chandler Moore, Both]
As long as I'm breathing
I've got a reason to
Praise the Lord (C'mon), oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
So how could I keep it inside? (I gotta)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
(Yeah, praise the Lord)

[Interlude: Brandon Lake]
C'mon let me see that dance, put a dance on it tonight (Yeah)
If you're grateful, c'mon
Hey, hey, yeah

[Bridge: Brandon Lake & Chris Brown]
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign, praise 'cause You reign
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful, praise 'cause You’re true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You
I'll praise 'cause You're sovereign, praise 'cause You reign (You reign)
Praise 'cause You rose and defeated the grave
I'll praise 'cause You're faithful, praise 'cause You’re true
Praise 'cause there's nobody greater than You

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Brandon Lake & Chandler Moore, All]
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul (Praise the Lord, oh my soul)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
Praise the Lord, oh my soul
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside? (How could I)
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside? (I won't keep quiet)
I won't be quiet, my God is alive
How could I keep it inside? (I gotta)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

[Outro: Chandler Moore]
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Let everything that has breath (Hey, hey)
Praise the Lord (Hey, hey), praise the Lord
Let everything, let everything that has breath
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Praise the Lord (C'mon, c'mon)
Praise the Lord (C'mon, c'mon)
(Let everything), Let everything that has breath
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord
(Let everything), Let everything that has breath
(Praise the Lord)
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, praise the Lord
