[Verse 1]
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will save our sons and daughters?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has come to make you new
And this child that you delivered
Will soon deliver you?

[Verse 2]
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will give sight to a blind man?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Will calm a storm with His hand?
Did you know that your baby boy
Has walked where angels trod
And when you kissed your little baby
You've kissed the face of God?

[Bridge]
Oh, Mary, did you know
Ooh, Mary, did you know, ooh

[Chorus]
Ooh, the blind will see
The deaf will hear
The dead will live again
The lame will leap
The dumb will speak
The praises of the lamb

[Verse 3]
Oh, Mary, did you know that your baby boy
Is Lord of all creation?
Mary did you know that your baby boy
Will one day rule the nation?
Did you know that your baby boy
Is Heaven's perfect lamb
And the sleeping child you're holding
Is the Great I Am?
Oh, Mary, oh...
