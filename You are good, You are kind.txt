You are good, You are kind
I have never seen Your kind
I’m devoted to Your praise
And forever to Your name

You are love, You are light
You make everything alright
I’m devoted to Your praise
And forever to Your name

You’re my King, You’re my Lord
You’re the mighty man of war
I’m devoted to Your praise
And forever to Your name

You’re my joy, You’re my hope
I will never be ashamed
I’m devoted to Your praise
And forever to Your name
