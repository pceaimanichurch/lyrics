I need thee every hour, ​
Most gracious lord;​
No tender voice like thine, ​
Can peace afford.​

I need thee, O I need thee;​
Every hour I need thee!​
O bless me now, my savior, ​
I come to thee.

I need thee every hour, ​
Stay thou near by;​
Temptations lose their pow’r, ​
When thou art nigh.

I need thee, O I need thee;​
Every hour I need thee!​
O bless me now, my savior, ​
I come to thee.

I need the every hour, ​
In joy or pain;​
Come quickly and abide, ​
Or life is vain.

I need thee, O I need thee;​
Every hour I need thee!​
O bless me now, my savior, ​
I come to thee.

I need thee every hour, ​
Most holy one ;​
O make me thine indeed, ​
Thou blessed Son.

I need thee, O I need thee;​
Every hour I need thee!​
O bless me now, my savior, ​
I come to thee.​​
