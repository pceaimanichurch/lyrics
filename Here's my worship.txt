Here's my worship
All of my worship
Receive my worship
All of my worship
Here's my worship (all of mine)
All of my worship (Father, receive my)
Receive my worship (all of my worship)
All of my worship

And I will not be silent
I will always worship You
As long as I am breathing
I will always worship You (saying "I will")
And I will not be silent (saying "I will")
I will always worship You (say "As long as")
As long as I am breathing (saying "I will")
I will always worship You (hey! Let's take it up in this place, and I will)
