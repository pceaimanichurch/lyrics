I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus,  
Hold to the Lamb of Calvary 
I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus 
And Jesus will hold on to me 

In this troubled world we live in; 
nothing seems to make sense 
Many looking' for the way,  
searching to and fro 
Sometimes this rope I'm holding 
Seems to be slipping 
But I'm gonna hold on tighter  
To the only hope I know 

I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus,  
Hold to the Lamb of Calvary 
I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus 
And Jesus will hold on to me 

Oh' Satan keeps on talking 
Saying' you can't make it 
Trying to convince me there's no use to try 
But I refuse to listen and keep right on goin' 
Trusting and believing' in the Jesus knots of time 

I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus,  
Hold to the Lamb of Calvary 
I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus 
And Jesus will hold on to me 

I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus,  
hold to the Lamb of Calvary 
I'm gonna hold on, hold on to Jesus 
and Jesus will hold on to me
