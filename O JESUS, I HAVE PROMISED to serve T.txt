O JESUS, I HAVE PROMISED to serve Thee to the end;.
Be Thou for ever near me, My Master and my Friend;
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side, Nor wander from the pathway If Thou wilt be my Guide.

Oh, let me feel Thee near me;
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle, The tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me, Around me and within;
But, Jesus draw Thou nearer, And shield my soul from sin.

Oh, let me hear Thee speaking, in accents clear and still, Above the storms of passion:
The murmurs of self-will; oh, speak to reassure me, To hasten, or control;
oh, speak, and make me listen, Thou Guardian of my soul.

O Jesus, Thou hast promised To all who follow Thee That where Thou art in glory There shall Thy servant be; And Jesus, I have promised To serve Thee to the end;
Oh, give me grace to follow, My Master and my Friend.

Oh, let me see Thy footprints, And in them plant mine own;
My hope to follow duly Is in Thy strength alone;
Oh, guide me, call me, draw me, Uphold me to the end;
And then in Heaven receive me, My Saviour and my Friend.
