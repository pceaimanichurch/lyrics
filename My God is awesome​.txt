My God is awesome​
He can move mountains​
Keep me in the valley​
Hide me from the rain​
My God is awesome​
Heals me when I'm broken​
strength where I've been weakened​
Forever He will reign​

​My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome​
My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome​

​My God is awesome​
Savior of the whole world​
Giver of salvation​
By His stripes I am healed​
My God is awesome​
Today I am forgiven​
His grace is why I'm living​
Praise His holy name​

​My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome​
My God is awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome​

My God is awesome, He can move mountains​
Keeps me in the valley, hides me from the rain​
My God is awesome, heals me when I'm broken​
Strength where I've been weakened, praise his holy name    ​
