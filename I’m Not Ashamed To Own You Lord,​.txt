I’m Not Ashamed To Own You Lord,​
Or To Defend Your Cause,​
Maintain The Honour Of Your Word,​
The Glory Of Your Cross. ​
​
At The Cross! At The Cross! ​
Where I First Saw The Light,​
And The Burden Of My Heart, Rolled Away​
It Was There By Faith, I Received My 	Sight,​
And Now I Am Happy All The Day!

Jesus My God! I Know Your Name​
Your Name Is All My Trust;​
Nor Will You Put My Soul To Shame,​
Nor Let My Hope Be Lost.​


At The Cross! At The Cross! ​
Where I First Saw The Light,​
And The Burden Of My Heart, Rolled Away​
It Was There By Faith, I Received My Sight,​
And Now I Am Happy All The Day!	​

​​Firm As Your Throne Your Promise Stands,​
And You Can Well Secure,​
What I’ve Committed To Your Hands​
Till The Decisive Hour.​

At The Cross! At The Cross! ​
Where I First Saw The Light,​
And The Burden Of My Heart, Rolled Away​
It Was There By Faith, I Received My Sight,​
And Now I Am Happy All The Day!

Then Will You Own My Worthless Name,​
Before Your Father’s Face;​
And In The New Jerusalem,​
Appoint My Soul A Place.​

At The Cross! At The Cross! ​
Where I First Saw The Light,​
And The Burden Of My Heart, Rolled Away​
It Was There By Faith, I Received My Sight,​
And Now I Am Happy All The Day!	​
