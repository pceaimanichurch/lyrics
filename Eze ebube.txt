More than my mouth can testify
More than my mind can comprehend
See I′ve seen the wonders of your grace
I'm so sure that this is not the end

Eze ebube
See how far you′ve brought me
Eze ebube
I'm so glad you found me worthy
I can see
I can tell
And I know it's your grace
All my days I will sing your praise

My heart is full of gratitude
To you and no one else but you
Lord I′m here only by your grace
Thank you Jesus for not giving up on me
Oh oh oh oh oh

Eze ebube
See how far you've brought me
Eze ebube
I′m so glad you found me worthy
I can see
I can tell
And I know it's your grace
All my days I will sing your praise

Grace found me
Grace saved me
Grace made me
Who I am
Grace redeemed me
Grace sustains me
Grace made me
Who I am

I can see
I can tell
And I know
It′s your grace
All my days
I will sing your praise
