Verse 1
Wonderful, merciful Savior
Precious Redeemer and Friend
Who would have thought that a Lamb could
Rescue the souls of men,
Oh You rescue the souls of men.

Chorus
You are the One that we praise
You are the One we adore
You give the healing and grace our
Hearts always hunger for,
Oh our hearts always hunger for.

Verse 2
Counselor, Comforter, Keeper
Spirit we long to embrace,
You offered hope when our hearts had
Hopelessly lost the way,
Oh we’d hopelessly lost the way.

Chorus
You are the One that we praise
You are the One we adore
You give the healing and grace our
Hearts always hunger for,
Oh our hearts always hunger for.

Verse 3
Almighty, infinite Father
Faithfully loving Your own.
Here in our weakness You find us
Falling before Your throne,
Oh we’re falling before Your Throne.

Chorus
You are the One that we praise
You are the One we adore
You give the healing and grace our
Hearts always hunger for,
Oh our hearts always hunger for.
