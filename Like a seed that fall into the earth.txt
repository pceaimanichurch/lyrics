1.Like a seed that fall into the earth
Buried in silence, waiting for birth 
Though it seems the end life will begin 
Through death surrendered, new hope comes in
 
A grain of wheat, must fall & die
To bring forth life, to multiply 
Through loss we find the greater plan
Your life in us, will never end

Jesus you laid down all for me
Through your cross, I am set free
Love poured out the harvest grows
Through every heart your mercy flows

On the mystery of the cross
Life was gained through what looked lost
From the ground, new life will rise
Glory shinning hope alive.

A grain of wheat must fall and die
To bring forth life to multiply Through loss
Through death to self your love is shown 
And in your kingdom, fruit is grown.  X2
